// ------------------------------------------------

// ATTENTION! private methods can`t be overridden cause they are not accessible - no rules for them - create anything u like

// rules for overridden methods (methods in parent and child, which have same name and params): if smth is wrong, it will not compile
// 1. accessibility of child method >= accessibility of parent`s
// 2. checked exceptions of child method <= checked exceptions of parent`s
// 3. returned type of child method <= returned type of parent`s (I mean child`s return type if the same or subclass of parent`s return type)

// --------------------------------------------------------

//what about STATICS?: all the same rules + u cant omit the modifier "static" while overriding (the child`s method has to keep "static")
// it is easy. As in the previous part, when we use overridden method, we expect the same behaviour. If we used that method in a static way (without an instance),
// we obviously have to have ability to use child`s one in the same manner
