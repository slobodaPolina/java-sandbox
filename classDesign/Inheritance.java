// ATTENTION! private methods can`t be overridden cause they are not accessible - no rules for them
// rules for overridden methods (methods in parent and child, which have same name and params): if smth is wrong, it will not compile
// accessibility of child method >= accessibility of parent`s
// checked exceptions of child method <= checked exceptions of parent`s
// returned type of child method <= returned type of parent`s (I mean child`s return type if the same or subclass of parent`s return type)

        // it means then we call concrete version of parent`s method, we expect it to behave the same way -
        // to return smth the same or smth can e easily mapped, we expect not to throw smth unexpected, we expect to be sure we can access to call the method at all!

// --------------------------------------------------------

//what about STATICS?: all the same rules + u cant omit the modifier "static" while overriding (the child`s method has to keep "static")
// it is easy. As in the previous part, when we use overridden method, we expect the same behaviour. If we used that method in a static way (without an instance),
// we obviously have to have ability to use child`s one in the same manner

// it is called "hiding", new static methods 'hide' the old ones and it is not called overriding

// hidden methods only replace parent methods in the calls defined in the child class.
